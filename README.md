:fire: &nbsp; ***How to run*** &nbsp; :fire:
1. Download the file from github or with the `git clone` command.
2. Install the items in requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run in victim's computer with: `python3 main.py`

:point_right: &nbsp; ***Recommended:*** &nbsp; :point_left:
- Use a USB/Flash Drive to run the Program. This way, once the program is finished, you can just eject the USB/Flash Drive and have all the system's data!
- Perform this on a Mac System if possible. <br> 
Though you can run this program on ANY system, most information that can be gathered is from Mac Operating Systems 
<br> (Due to their use of specific commands)

:wrench: &nbsp; ***How it works:*** &nbsp; :wrench:
1. Program runs non-sudo/administrative commands automatically in the terminal/cmd-line
2. Outputs of these commands are sent into multiple different files (To the file with the OS's name)
3. Done! Now you have files of their entire system's information!
