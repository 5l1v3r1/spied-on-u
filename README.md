### Introduction

*This is a piece of spyware made to log hardware data of victims.*

Recommended:
- Use a USB/Flash Drive to run the Program. This way, once the program is finished, you can just eject the USB/Flash Drive and have all the system's data!
- Perform this on a Mac System if possible. <br> 
Though you can run this program on ANY system, most information that can be gathered is from Mac Operating Systems 
<br> (Due to their use of specific commands)

How it works:
1. Program runs non-sudo/administrative commands automatically in the terminal/cmd-line
2. Outputs of these commands are sent into multiple different files (To the file with the OS's name)
3. Done! Now you have files of their entire system's information!
